Data dashboard applications can use the APIs as follows.

`GET */subject/{subjectId}/variables/observations`

Get all configured users for a particular source-type use `GET */users?source-type={source-type}`

### Registering OAuth Clients with ManagementPortal

To add new OAuth clients, you can add at runtime through the UI on Management Portal, or you can add them to the OAuth
clients file referenced by the `MANAGEMENTPORTAL_OAUTH_CLIENTS_FILE` configuration option. For more info,
see [officail docs](https://github.com/RADAR-base/ManagementPortal#oauth-clients)
The OAuth client for authorizer-app-backend should have the following properties.

```properties

resources:res_DataDashboardAPI
scope:MEASUREMENT.READ
```
